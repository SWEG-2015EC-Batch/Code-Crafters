##Problem Analysis:
The given code represents a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations on numeric values. Here's a brief problem analysis:

1.Initialization of Variables: operands, operator, and result.
User Input:

2.The program prompts the user to enter the first operand  and enters a loop that continues until the user inputs '0'.
Main Loop:

3.Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter an operation (+, -, *, /, =, or '0' to exit).
The program then switches based on the entered operation.
Operation Handling:

4.If '0' is entered, the loop is exited.
For other operations (+, -, *, /):
The user is prompted to enter the next operand .
The program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on witet based on the entered operator.
Division by Zero Check:

5.Before performing division, the code checks if the divisor  is not equal to zero to avoid division by zero errors.
Displaying Results:

6.The final result  is displayed once the loop exits.
