6, time taken to transmit file

Input -Enter file size and transmission speed

process -change transmission speed in char per second to in byte per second , time in second =file size/transmission  speed byte per second and convert time in second to times in days

Output- print time taken in second and time taken in days

Pseudocode

Step 1- start 

Step2-Enter file size and transmission speed

Step3-convert entered transmission transmission speed in char per second to in byte per second

Step 4-calculate time taken in second =file size/transmission  speed byte per second 

Step 5-time taken in days =time taken in second /86400

Step 6-stop
