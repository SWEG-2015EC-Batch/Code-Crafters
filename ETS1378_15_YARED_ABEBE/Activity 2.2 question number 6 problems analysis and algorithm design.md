6, time taken to transmit file
Input -Enter file size and transmission speed
process -change transmission speed in char per second to in byte per second , time in second =file size/transmission  speed byte per second and convert time in second to times in days
Output- print time taken in second and time taken in days
Pseudocode
Step 1- start 
Step2-Enter file size and transmission speed
Step3-convert entered transmission transmission speed in char per second to in byte per second
Step 4-calculate time taken in second =file size/transmission  speed byte per second 
Step 5-time taken in days =time taken in second /86400
Step 6-stop
