Analysis
Input – transmission speed = 960 bytes/sec
       file size = 400mb = 419430400 bytes

Process – Time in second = file size / transmission speed
Time in day = Time in second / 86400
             
Output- Print Time in second, Time in day.

Pseudocode 

Step 1 - Start 

Step 2- Accept transmission speed = 960 
bytes/sec & file size = 400mb = 419430400 bytes

Step 3-Calculate Time in second 

Step 4- Calculate Time in day

Step 5 -Print Time in second, Time in day.

Step 6-Stop
